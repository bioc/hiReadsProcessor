hiReadsProcessor R package

Objective: Given a sampleInformation file (xls/txt) with sample and metadata information, automate the processing of a sequencing run of LM-PCR samples. 

The sampleInformation file has few required columns like: barcode, samplename, sample description, species, freeze, gender, primer sequence, linker sequence, and restriction enzyme. Additional columns are considered as metadata and saved in an object. 

To fine tune sample specific processing, add any settings/parameters to the file apriori. For example, quality thresholds of primer or linker alignment, or integration site clustering thresholds, etc.
