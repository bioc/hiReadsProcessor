Description: hiReadsProcessor contains set of functions which allow
    users to process LM-PCR products sequenced using any platform.
    Given an excel/txt file containing parameters for
    demultiplexing and sample metadata, the functions automate
    trimming of adaptors and identification of the genomic product.
    Genomic products are further processed for QC and abundance
    quantification.
