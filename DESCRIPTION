Description: hiReadsProcessor contains set of functions which allow users to
    process single-end LM-PCR sequence data coming out of the 454/Illumina
    sequencer. Given an excel file containing parameters for demultiplexing and
    sample metadata, the functions automate trimming of adaptors and
    identification of the genomic product. In addition, if IntSites MySQL
    database is setup, the sequence attrition is loaded into respective tables
    for post processing setup and analysis.
